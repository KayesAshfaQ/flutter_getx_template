[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,

## Discovering Project
After setting up all the needed thing now lets talk about folder structure which is mainly based on Getx Pattern and there are some personal opinions, if you open your lib folder you will find those folders

```
.
└── lib
    ├── app
    │   ├── components
    │   ├── data
    │   │   ├── local
    │   │   └── models
    │   ├── modules
    │   │   └── home
    │   ├── routes
    │   └── services
    ├── config
    │   ├── theme
    │   └── translation
    └── utils
```

- app: will contain all our core app logic
  - components: will contain all the shared UI widgets
  - data: will contain our models and local data sources (local db & shared pref)
  - modules: app screens
  - routes: generated by get_cli and it will contain our navigation routes
  - services: contain all logic for making safe & clean api calls
- config: will contain app config such as themes, localization services
- utils: for our helper classes
## Features
- Theme: if you opened theme package you will see those files

    ```
    └── theme
        ├── dark_theme_colors.dart
        ├── light_theme_colors.dart
        ├── my_fonts.dart
        ├── my_styles.dart
        └── my_theme.dart
   
    ```

  you only need to change app colors (light/dark_theme_colors) and if you want to change app fonts sizes and family just modify my_fonts.dart and that is it you don't need to worry about styles and theme you only need to edit my_syles.dart if you want to change some element theme data (padding,border..etc) and if you want to change theme just use this code
